This is a fast solution to make a prototype for data merging from excel tables.

Content:
- a PAD Desktop flow for building up the folders and prototype Excel tables
  - The folder is set to my table path, so it has to be changed 
- a PAD Desktop flow for merging the data from Excel tables
  - Pop-up folder selection
  - Reading all the folders from the selected folders
  - Reading the .xlsx files in the subfolders
  - merging and writing the content to a new .xlsx file
 - The .xaml file with the VBA macro.
   - The macro is needed to find the colored cells in the files. I know it's not the best solution, but I just wanted a fast solution
